# Mirrorman
Just a quickie, compiles a list of Google dorks that you can then use to document which backend servers that Google has to offer.


usage: python3 suredude.py > list.txt

then use the list, one by one, Or I suggest using bulkURL opener https://melanto.com/apps/bulk-url-opener/ to search for each line on Google for what backend servers are available on Google. I'll work up a list from here and probably upload it and keep it updated for a week or two to give me something to do.
